What is phishing?

A phishing attack is a fraudulent email, text, or voice message designed to trick people into:
â€¢	Downloading malware (e.g., ransomware)
â€¢	Revealing sensitive information (usernames, passwords, credit card details)
â€¢	Sending money to cybercriminals
ðŸ”¹ How Does a Phishing Simulation Work?
â€¢	Employees receive mock phishing emails that look like real ones.
â€¢	Messages use social engineering tactics (urgency, impersonation, fake invoices).
â€¢	If employees click a link, download an attachment, or enter details, they fail the test (but no harm is done).
â€¢	Some simulations redirect employees to a training page showing tips to avoid phishing in the future.
ðŸ”¹ Why is it Important?
â€¢	Tests real-world readiness
â€¢	Identifies employees who need more training
â€¢	Collects useful metrics (e.g., click rates, report rates)
â€¢	Improves overall cybersecurity awareness


Steps for phishing

1. Planning
â€¢	Define objectives and scope of the simulation.
â€¢	Decide on the type of phishing emails (e.g., fake invoices, password resets, urgent requests).
â€¢	Set the frequency of tests (one-time, monthly, quarterly).
â€¢	Select the target audience (all employees, departments, or executives).
2. Drafting
â€¢	Create realistic phishing emails modelled after real-world attacks.
â€¢	Use details like subject lines, sender addresses, and content formatting.
â€¢	Apply social engineering tactics such as urgency, fear, or executive impersonation to increase believability.
3. Sending
â€¢	Deploy simulated phishing emails securely to the target audience.
â€¢	Ensure employee privacy while running the test.
4. Monitoring
â€¢	Track how employees interact with emails.
â€¢	Record actions such as clicking links, downloading attachments, or sharing sensitive data.
5. Analyzing & Feedback
â€¢	Review collected data (e.g., click rates, report rates, response times).
â€¢	Identify security vulnerabilities and high-risk groups.
â€¢	Provide immediate feedback and training to employees who failed the test.
